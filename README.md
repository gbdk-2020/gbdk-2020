## Docs
GBDK includes extensive [documentation](https://gbdk.org/docs/api). A good place to begin is the [Getting Started Section](https://gbdk.org/docs/api/docs_getting_started.html).

Check the [Links and Third-Party Tools Section](https://gbdk.org/docs/api/docs_links_and_tools.html) for a list of recommended emulators, graphics tools, music drivers and more.

For SDCC you can check its [website](http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/) and the [manual](http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/doc/sdccman.pdf)


## Usage
Most users will only need to download and unzip the latest [release](https://github.com/gbdk-2020/gbdk-2020/releases)

Then go to the examples folder and build them (with `compile.bat` on Windows or running `make`). They are a good starting point.

The sources in this repo are only needed if you want to re-compile GBDK-2020 yourself instead of using the release binaries linked above.

## Current status
- Updated CRT and library that suits better for game development
- SDCC Versions
  - A [custom build of SDCC](https://github.com/gbdk-2020/gbdk-2020-sdcc/releases) is used with [patches](https://github.com/gbdk-2020/gbdk-2020-sdcc/releases/tag/patches) to support Sega GG/SMS and the Nintendo NES. See the [github workflow](https://github.com/gbdk-2020/gbdk-2020-sdcc/tree/main/.github/workflows) for details of how to patch and build SDCC.
  - The default calling convention changed in `SDCC 4.2`. This is supported starting with `GBDK-2020 4.1.0`. Older versions of GBDK should use SDCC builds #12539 or older (see per-version GBDK notes).
- The compiler driver **lcc** supports the latest sdcc toolchain.


## Origin
Over the years people have been complaining about all the GBDK issues caused by a very old version of SDCC (the compiler). This is a proper attempt of updating it while also keeping all the old functionality working, like support for banked code and data and so on.

The last version in the OLD repo is [2.96](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gbdk/files/gbdk/2.96/) although releases are available until 2.95-3. Version [2.96](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gbdk/files/gbdk/2.96/) is the starting point of this repo.


# Build instructions
Unless you are interested on recompiling the sources for some reason (like fixing some bugs) **you don't need to build GBDK**

- **Windows only**: Download and install [mingw](http://mingw-w64.org/)
- Clone, download this repo or just get the source from the [releases](https://github.com/gbdk-2020/gbdk-2020/releases)
- Download and install the **PATCHED** [sdcc builds](https://github.com/gbdk-2020/gbdk-2020-sdcc/releases) from the separate repo for that (https://github.com/gbdk-2020/gbdk-2020-sdcc).
- On Linux **don't use package managers** The latest release available won't work, you need to compile or download one of the nightlies
- Create **SDCCDIR** environment variable, that points into the folder, where you installed sdcc
- Open command prompt or a terminal, go to the root directory of the repo and run **make**
